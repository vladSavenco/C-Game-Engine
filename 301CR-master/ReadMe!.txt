If you want to run just the application, open the DogeyEngine folder inside 301Cr and run the launcher.
Be advised that you will need .NET 5.0, to install this just use the visual studio configurator.

In game:
-WASD for character movement
-H for heal
-U for attack
-P&L to dissable/ennable the enemy ai

The launcher and game are in the dogy engine folder. the launcher gives you access to all the data folders
of the engine, most things are customisable with lua, some are hard-coded.

The level editor is more a model viewer as it allows you to view a model edit it and will then prin to console all
the data you may need to bring the model in the game.
